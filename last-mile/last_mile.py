Optimize E-Commerce Last-Mile Delivery with Python
Organize your routes to deliver parcels with a minimum number of drivers using optimization models with python

If you travel to first and second-tier cities of China, you will find on the street many delivery drivers

They take the parcels from small warehouses called customer service centres
located in each neighbourhood and deliver them to the final customers.

These centres are key elements of the Logistics Network of the major courier companies in China.
They provide a large geographical coverage for last-mile delivery and a huge competitive advantage by offering
the best service level and delivery lead time in the market.

Before arriving at your door, your parcel will be picked up from the vendorâ€™s warehouse, transit through several
regional distribution centres and will finally arrive at the service centre of your neighbourhood.

When your parcel arrives at the centre, you will receive a notification on your phone to inform you that a courier
 will deliver your parcel during the day.

This article will present a solution to optimize the last-mile delivery from these centres to reduce the costs and
ensure a uniform distribution of the workload to each driver.

Problem Statement
You are a manager in a local service centre with

* 4 drivers in your team
* 15 parcel capacity per vehicle
* 16 destinations to cover in the neighbourhood named Dj with j in [1, 16]
* D0 is the centre
* 1 route per driver

Capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) with Google OR-Tools

OR-Tools is an open-source collection of Google with tools for combinatorial optimization.
The objective is to find the best solution out of a very large set of possible solutions.

Let us try to use this library to build the optimal routes.

Conclusion
This model can help the centre manager to

Optimize his fleet with full utilization of his drivers and vehicles
Ensure that the workload is equally distributed among each driver
Question:

What could be the results with higher capacity (boxes) per driver?
What could be the results if we have a weight or volume constraint?
I let you test it and share your results (or questions) in the comment area.
