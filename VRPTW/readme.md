# Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)

Many vehicle routing problems involve scheduling visits to customers who are only available during specific time windows. 
These problems are known as vehicle routing problems with time windows (VRPTWs).


Since the problem involves time windows, the data include a time matrix, which contains the travel times between locations 
(rather than a distance matrix as in VRP).

The diagram below shows the locations to visit in blue and the depot in black. 

The time windows are shown above each location.

The goal is to minimize the total travel time of the vehicles.
